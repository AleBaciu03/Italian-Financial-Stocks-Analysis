# Italian-Financial-Stocks-Analysis
This project analyzes the performance of a portfolio of four major stocks listed on the Italian Stock Exchange: Fineco, Intesa San Paolo, Generali, and UniCredit, starting from January 1, 2015.
The Python script uses the yfinance, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to download historical data, calculate normalized returns, analyze volatility, and visualize correlations between the stocks.

1. Normalized Returns Chart: Compares the performance of the stocks over time, starting from the same initial value.

2. Violin Plot: Shows the distribution and density of daily price changes for each stock, allowing for an assessment of their volatility.

3. Histograms: Details the frequency of price changes for each stock.
